# DFA-NFA

This project involves solving a set of 10 problems using Finite State Automata (FSA), with the solutions implemented in Java. For each problem, we are required to:

Design the FSA (either DFA or NFA), draw the state diagram, and submit it as a PDF.
Implement the solution in Java, where the program reads input from a text file and processes it based on the problem requirements.
Output the results in a specified format in an output text file.
The project includes solving various string matching, validation, and parsing problems using Finite State Automata concepts, and processing input and output files accordingly.

Features
# 1. Problem-Solving Using FSA
Each of the 10 problems will involve:

Designing a suitable Finite State Automaton (FSA) that processes the given input and produces the expected output.
Implementing a Java solution that mimics the behavior of the automaton by using state transitions and processing logic.
Generating an output text file that contains the results of processing the input text according to the problem's requirements.
# 2. Problem Types
Validation of strings (e.g., checking if a string belongs to a particular language or matches a certain pattern).
Recognition of specific patterns in text (e.g., identifying valid email addresses, phone numbers, etc.).
Parsing or extracting information based on given criteria.
Other FSA-related tasks, such as determining membership in a set, matching sequences, etc.
